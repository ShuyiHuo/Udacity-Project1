In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. The goal is to check if the user is in the group.

It will spent O(nlogn) times since it needs to travers the whole group tree using recursion to match the user, and space complexity is O(nm) if the maximun of depth of recursion tree is m.
