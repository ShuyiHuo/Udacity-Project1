For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with a â€œ.c" extension. My idea is using recursion to traverse the file hierarchy tree and then print out the path. 

It will spent O(nlogn) times since it need to traverses the file hierarchy using recursion and space complexity is O(nm) if the maximun of depth of recursion tree is m.
